## Manga Catalogue

### Intro
This web app is a simple one to search different mangas by the title and get the information about the certain ones. Also it is made as the one where you could read manga if I owned the all rights for them (of course I do not, it is just a simple project to demonstrate my skills). All the data is got from the [MyAnimeList website](https://myanimelist.net/) with the [Jikan API](https://docs.api.jikan.moe/).
